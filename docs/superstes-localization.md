# SUPERSTES Localization Design Document

**v1.** Owns: how a translation is stored, built, loaded and typeset. Companion to
[superstes-tech-design.md](superstes-tech-design.md) (which owns the engine those hooks sit in),
[superstes-script.md](superstes-script.md) and
[superstes-chapter-2-script.md](superstes-chapter-2-script.md) (which own the narrative a
translation is a translation *of*), and [superstes-sound-design.md](superstes-sound-design.md)
(which is untouched — audio does not localize).

Like the tech doc, this file contains **no narrative content**. Translated prose lives in
`content/<lang>/`.

---

## 1. What a translation is

A **content pack**: one generated file, `js/content-<lang>.js`, that hands `I18N.register()` a
complete set of chapter data plus a UI table. It is loaded by a plain `<script>` tag like every
other data file. Nothing about the engine changes shape to accommodate it.

English is **not** a pack. It is the source language and it stays exactly where it has always
been — as literals in `js/scenes.js`, `js/endings.js`, `js/wall.js`, the `-c2` trio, and in
`index.html`'s title screen. There is no `content/en/`. A parallel copy of the English text would
be a second source of truth for it, and the first thing to go stale.

Currently shipping: **`zh`** — Simplified Chinese.

---

## 2. Where the text lives

```
/content
  /zh
    scenes-c1.json     // the SCENES_C1 array, translated
    endings-c1.json    // ENDINGS_C1
    callback-c1.json   // WITNESS_CALLBACK_C1
    wall-c1.json       // WALL_C1
    scenes-c2.json     // SCENES_C2
    endings-c2.json    // ENDINGS_C2
    callback-c2.json   // DEPARTURE_CALLBACK
    wall-c2.json       // WALL_C2
    ui.json            // the UI table + the title screen's copy
```

These are the masters, and they are pure JSON on purpose: a translator can open them in anything,
hand them to anyone, and diff them, without needing to know that the game is JavaScript. This is
the whole reason the split exists — the English prose is embedded in `.js` files with comments
around it, which is fine for the author and hostile to anyone editing only the words.

`js/content-zh.js` is the **generated artifact** and is committed. Never hand-edit it. This is the
same bargain the art and audio pipelines make (CLAUDE.md, *Known intentional deviations*): the
master is the truth, the artifact is what ships, and the artifact is committed because the game
must run over `file://` with no build step and no `fetch` (tech doc §1). Fetching the JSON at
runtime would work over `http://` and silently fail for anyone who opened `index.html` directly.

---

## 3. The build

```bash
scripts/build_content.py zh          # content/zh/*.json -> js/content-zh.js
scripts/build_content.py --check zh  # validate only, write nothing
```

`--check` is the useful half. Before writing anything the script evaluates the real English data
files (with `node`, dev-only — the game never needs it) and walks the translated tree against
them:

- **Shape must match exactly.** No added, dropped or reordered entries. A missing scene, a
  reordered `options` array, a renamed key: all rejected with a path (`scenes-c1[2].tier2[3].id`).
- **Structural values must be identical.** `id`, `value`, `flagKey`, `keys`, `match`, `next`,
  `morse`, `requiresExamined`, `image`, `background`, `widget`, `layout`, `prefix`, `numeral`,
  `maxLength`, `final`, `secretPhrase`. These are what the state machine matches on; a translated
  `value: "called"` breaks a reactive block silently, which is exactly the failure this catches.
- **Tokens and inline markup must balance.** `{morse}`, `{player_name}`, and the `<em>` /
  `<strong>` pairs the renderer passes through as HTML must appear the same number of times as in
  the English.
- **No empty strings.**

If `node` is absent the structural check is skipped with a warning and the pack still builds. The
check is a convenience, not a dependency.

Run `--check` after editing the JSON and before committing. Run the plain build after that.

## 4. Runtime

`js/i18n.js` loads first, before any data file. It exposes:

| Call | Used by | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `I18N.register(pack)` | the generated packs | adds a language |
| `I18N.resolve()` | `main.js` boot | reads `?lang=`, falls back to English |
| `I18N.content(name, fallback)` | `chapters.js` | the pack's copy of a data global, or the English one |
| `I18N.ui(key)` | `main.js`, `gallery.js`, `audio.js` | one engine-composed string, English if the pack omits it |
| `I18N.setLang(target)` | `main.js` `switchLanguage()` | swaps the pack, the URL and nothing visible |
| `I18N.applyLang()` | `main.js` boot and the swap point | paints the page in the active language |
| `I18N.warmText(sample)` | `main.js` `switchLanguage()` | pulls the font subsets those words need |
| `I18N.mountToggle(btn, onSwitch)` | `main.js` boot | wires the standing toggle |

**Load order** becomes: `i18n.js` → every chapter's data files → the content packs →
`chapters.js` → `audio.js` → `gallery.js` → `main.js`.

**`chapters.js` is the only seam.** A chapter's four getters go through `I18N.content()`, so the
`SCENES` / `ENDINGS` / `WALL` / `SHARED_CALLBACK` pointer swap already described in tech doc
§ *Two chapters, one page* now swaps language as well as chapter, at no extra cost. `main.js` and
`gallery.js` still do not know either axis exists.

**Language is the URL and nothing else.** `?lang=zh`. There is no persistence in this game by
design (tech doc §1), so there is nowhere else to keep it. An unregistered `?lang=` value falls
back to English rather than erroring, as does a pack that fails to load.

**The toggle is a standing control**, the sound button's twin, directly beneath it and live for
the whole run — not a title-screen link. That makes switching mid-run the normal case, so it must
not cost the player anything, and it does not reload. `main.js`'s `switchLanguage()`:

1. `I18N.setLang(target)` swaps the active pack and rewrites the URL with `history.replaceState`
   (preserving `?debug=`, `?all` and the rest). It changes **nothing visible** — see below.
2. `relocalizeChapter()` re-runs the current chapter's four getters. Because they read through
   `I18N.content()`, that re-points `SCENES` / `ENDINGS` / `WALL` / `SHARED_CALLBACK` at the same
   chapter's other language. It is `activateChapter()` without the resets.
3. `I18N.warmText()` is handed the words about to be painted, so their font subsets download during
   the fade rather than after it.
4. The view repaints, and `I18N.applyLang()` fires **on the same frame the words change**.

**`setLang` and `applyLang` are split for one reason.** `body[data-lang]` carries the whole font
block — stack, line height, measure, italic rules — so the frame it flips on is the frame the page
changes typeface. Flipping it when the pack changes, while a 400ms scene fade still has the old
language's words on screen, set English prose in a kai face with CJK metrics for most of half a
second. That was the "weird font in between". `applyLang()` is therefore called at the exact swap
point, which differs by what is on screen:

| On screen | Where `applyLang()` fires |
|---|---|
| Title screen | immediately — it rewrites that copy itself, so words and face change together |
| A scene or ending | inside `fadeOut`'s `onSwap` hook, the instant the old content is removed |
| A plate | immediately, with `relocalizePlate()` rewriting the caption in place |
| The tally wall | immediately, with `Gallery.relabel()` rebuilding it in place |

Plates and the wall are fixed overlays outside `#scene-content`: a scene repaint does not reach
them, so each is rewritten in place and the scene repainting behind them is invisible. Both are
checked **before** the `playing` test, because `?all` opens the wall over the title screen.

**English needs a snapshot.** English has no `title` block — it *is* the markup — which was true
right up until a pack overwrote that markup, and switching no longer reloads the page to bring it
back. So `applyLang()` snapshots every `[data-i18n]` node (plus `<title>` and the meta description)
on its first call, before anything is written over them, and restores from that when the active
pack has no `title`. Still one copy of the English, still in `index.html`; this only remembers what
it said.

Nothing the run has earned is language, so nothing is lost: `flags`, `examined`, the wall's `seen`
count, the carved name, the active chapter and the current scene all survive. `Gallery.relabel()`
drops only the caption cache (built against the old language's `SCENES`/`ENDINGS`) and rebuilds an
open wall in place — unlike `reset()`, which is the chapter switch and does clear the count. The
replacement opens **already opaque** and keeps the previous `scrollTop`: letting it run the normal
fade in showed the title screen through it, and resetting the scroll lost the reader's place.

`{ repaint: true }` suppresses the scene's opening plate: a plate is an arrival beat, and replaying
it over a scene the player has been sitting in reads as the game restarting. The bed does not
restart either — `playBed` recognises the same key and simply holds.

**The one casualty** is position *within* a scene. `runtime.answered` is rebuilt with the scene, so
the reactive chain repaints from its first prompt. Answering again writes the same flag it already
holds, so nothing downstream changes; it is a repeated question, not a lost one. The alternative
was reloading, which loses the entire run in a game with no saves. Not close.

**The title screen** is static HTML, and English is that HTML. A pack overrides it through
`data-i18n="key"` (sets `textContent`) and `data-i18n-html="key"` (sets `innerHTML`, for the two
lines carrying `<em>`), both resolved against the pack's `title` block; blurb lines are indexed,
`data-i18n="blurb.0"`. `docTitle` and `metaDescription` are applied to `<title>` and the meta tag.
Adding a line to the blurb means adding it to the packs — `--check` enforces the count of nine.

**Engine-composed strings** (the ones no data file owns) live in `UI_EN` in `i18n.js` and in each
pack's `ui` block: `examine`, `continue`, `plate`, `unnamedPlayer`, `registerCount`, `soundOn`,
`soundOff`, `calendarTitle`, `calendarWeekdays`. A pack that omits one degrades to
English for that string rather than to `undefined`.

The wall's own copy is **not** here — it is narrative-adjacent and lives in `WALL_*`, so a
translation gets it from `wall-c1.json` / `wall-c2.json` like everything else.

---

## 5. What does not localize

- **Morse.** The three water-clocks drip `SOL STAT. TERRA MOVET. EGO PRAECEDENS.` in Latin, in
  International Morse. The game never translates it in any language (script doc, *Deliberate
  Decisions*); the wall's hidden plaque still answers in Latin and translates *that* into the
  reading language. `secretPhrase` is a structural value and `--check` will reject a translated one.
- **Asset filenames, ids, flag values, scene ids.** Same reason.
- **Audio.** No spoken word in the game, so nothing to redub. The sound toggle's `aria-label` is
  the only audio-adjacent string and it comes from the UI table.
- **The wordmark.** "Superstes" is Latin and is the game's name; it stays in blackletter in every
  language. The gloss beneath it is translated.
- **The calendar's grid.** May 1543 began on a Tuesday everywhere. Only its caption and weekday
  initials localize.
- **Roman numerals** on the wall and the chapter doors.

---

## 6. Typography

Every face in `css/style.css` is reached through six variables in `:root`, so a language swaps its
entire typographic register in one `body[data-lang="…"]` block rather than at ~40 call sites. Keep
it that way; the block is the point.

For `zh` (`body[data-lang="zh"]`):

| Slot | English | Chinese | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--display` | Grenze Gotisch | Ma Shan Zheng | a cursive brush hand, far enough from the body face to keep the hierarchy the blackletter gave the English |
| `--head` / `--body` / `--label` / `--cal-mono` | Grenze Gotisch / Grenze / Special Elite | LXGW WenKai Screen (`--kai`) | see below |
| `--cal-title` | Mrs Saint Delafield | Ma Shan Zheng | the calendar's own hand |

**The body face is a 楷体, and that is the whole decision.** Kai is brush-derived regular script:
the stroke entries and exits of a written hand are still in it. A Song/Ming face — Noto Serif SC,
which this shipped with first — is the Chinese newspaper letter, upright and mechanical, and it
made the narration read like a report. The entire story is one person remembering out loud, in a
hand; kai is the closest Chinese equivalent to the face the English is set in.

Google Fonts carries no kai at all, so `LXGW WenKai Screen` (霞鹜文楷, SIL OFL) comes from jsDelivr
as ~26 unicode-range subsets — a page pulls only the characters it uses. The `--kai` stack falls
back through the system kai faces (`Kaiti SC`, `STKaiti`, `TW-Kai`, `KaiTi`, `BiauKai`) for anyone
offline, and to Noto Serif SC behind those; only one of them is ever downloaded. WenKai ships a
single weight, which is why the `zh` block sets no `font-weight` — asking for 300 only invited a
synthesised thin from the fallbacks.

Three adjustments that are corrections, not taste:

1. **Line height and measure.** CJK glyphs are full-width with no ascender/descender air, so Latin
   line-heights read cramped: `line-height: 2`, and `--measure` drops from 34rem to 30rem because a
   CJK line needs fewer characters to fill it.
2. **Letter-spacing.** Nearly every `.label` rule sets tracking for the small-caps Latin look. On
   CJK that reads as broken text, not as tracking, so it is flattened to `0.02em` — except on the
   Roman numerals and register headings, which are still Latin.
3. **Italics.** Noto Serif SC ships no italic, so every `font-style: italic` in the stylesheet
   becomes a synthesised oblique, which is not an emphasis convention in Chinese and reads as a
   rendering fault. Whole-block italics (the blurb, plates, the closing response, the wall's
   translation) go upright — they are already set apart by size, colour and measure. Inline `<em>`,
   which carries real stress in the prose, takes 着重号 instead: `text-emphasis: sesame`,
   positioned **under** the line (over is the Japanese convention). `<em>` wrapping a whole quoted
   line — remembered speech in the plates and the Latin gloss — is exempted, because a full row of
   sesame marks reads as damage.

Every pack is loaded by every player, in every language — `js/content-zh.js` is ~90KB of text,
against ~130KB for the English data files and ~31MB of audio, so gating it behind the chosen
language would buy nothing and would cost the "plain `<script>` tags, no async loading" convention
that keeps `file://` working. Revisit only if the pack count grows.

**Fonts are warmed before they are needed.** WenKai arrives as ~97 unicode-range subsets, so a
switch would otherwise fetch its glyphs at the moment they first paint and `font-display: swap`
would show a fallback for a beat — on the very frame the player is watching. Two calls avoid that:
hovering or focusing the toggle warms the target pack's title copy (the high-frequency subsets every
scene needs), and the switch itself warms the exact words about to appear, which then have the
length of the fade to arrive in. Both go through `I18N.warmText()`, which is family-agnostic on
purpose — it asks every registered `@font-face` to load that text, and a face whose unicode-range
does not cover it is never fetched. The font stack stays defined only in the stylesheet.

The two CJK faces are pulled from Google Fonts in `index.html` alongside the Latin ones. They are
requested unconditionally; splitting the request by language would need JS in `<head>` and would
cost a flash of unstyled text to save a request the browser makes in parallel anyway.

## 7. Adding a language

1. `cp -r content/zh content/<lang>` and translate every string value in place.
2. Set `lang`, `htmlLang`, `toggleGlyph`, `toggleLabel` and `toggleAria` in `ui.json`. All of them
   describe the button **while that language is active** — the Chinese pack offers `A` / "English",
   English offers `文` / "中文" — so each pack carries the mark for leaving itself, and the button
   never has to reason about direction. `toggleGlyph` must be one or two characters (`--check`
   enforces it): it is set inside a 2.6rem circle beside the sound button. English's own entry
   lives in `i18n.js`'s `packs.en`.
3. `scripts/build_content.py --check <lang>` until clean, then `scripts/build_content.py <lang>`.
4. Add `<script src="js/content-<lang>.js"></script>` to `index.html`, after the English data files
   and before `chapters.js`.
5. Add a `body[data-lang="<lang>"]` block to `css/style.css` if the script needs different faces or
   metrics, and add its faces to the font links in `index.html`.
6. Update `NAMES` in `scripts/build_content.py`, §1 of this doc, and the README.

`I18N.mountToggle` offers exactly one alternative language and picks the first registered pack. A
third language needs a real picker rather than a toggle — that is a UI decision this doc has not
made.

---

## 8. Translating well

The script docs own tone and are the reference for it. Two things a translator should know that
are not visible in the JSON:

- **The narrator is one voice across both chapters** — retrospective, flat about strange things,
  unhurried. Chapter I is period-inflected and Chapter II is deliberately plainer. The gap between
  them is load-bearing, so do not level it.
- **The endings are assembled from fragments**: `baseOpening` → `conditionalMiddle` row →
  the shared callback → `specificCallback` (Ending C only) → `closing`, concatenated with blank
  lines (tech doc §4). Every row of a `conditionalMiddle` table has to read as the same paragraph
  regardless of which one is drawn, and has to join cleanly to the same opening and the same
  closing. Translate a table as a set, not row by row.

The Chinese pack is pitched toward 苏童's register — concrete, damp, unhurried, fatalistic without
raising its voice — which is a close match for the original's water, fog and mildew, and for a
narrator who reports the impossible without commenting on it.
