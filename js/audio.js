// TESTIS — sound. Implements docs/testis-sound-design.md.
//
// Audio is optional enhancement: the game is fully playable and coherent with
// sound off. It is on by default and the player can turn it off at any time.
//
// Browsers will not let a page make noise before the player has interacted
// with it, so "on by default" cannot mean "sounding on page load". It means:
// armed, and sounding at the first gesture. In practice that gesture is
// "Enter the fog", which happens before the first scene paints — so the bed
// comes up with Scene 1 and the player never sees the seam. If playback is
// refused anyway (a debug jump, a browser with a stricter policy), the next
// click or keypress anywhere on the page starts it. Sound never starts
// itself without a gesture, and it never asks.
//
// This file owns every filename under assets/sound/ and every decision about
// when a sound plays. main.js only reports what just happened (a scene
// started, a hotspot opened, a branch was answered) through the `Sound`
// facade at the bottom; it holds no audio state and no filenames.
//
// No narrative content lives in this file.
